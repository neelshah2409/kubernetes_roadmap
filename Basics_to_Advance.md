Answer: A ServiceAccount in Kubernetes is an identity associated with a pod or group of pods. It provides an authentication mechanism for pods to interact with the Kubernetes API server or other services, allowing them to access resources or perform actions based on assigned roles and permissions.

### 95. Explain  the  concept  of  a  ResourceQuota  in  Kubernetes.

Answer: A ResourceQuota in Kubernetes is a resource object used to limit and manage the allocation of compute resources, such as CPU, memory, and storage, within a namespace. It allows administrators to define usage limits, ensuring fair resource distribution and preventing resource exhaustion by applications within the namespace.

### 96. What  is  the  purpose  of  a  NetworkPolicy  in  Kubernetes?

Answer: A NetworkPolicy in Kubernetes is a resource object used to define and enforce  network  tramc  rules  and  policies  for  pods.  It  provides  fine-grained  control over  network  access  between  pods,  allowing  administrators  to  specify  ingress  and egress rules based on IP addresses, ports, or other metadata.

### 97. Describe  the  concept  of  Horizontal  Pod  Autoscaling  in  Kubernetes.

Answer: Horizontal Pod Autoscaling in Kubernetes is a feature that automatically adjusts the number of replica pods based on CPU utilization or other custom metrics. It ensures that the desired level of resource utilization is maintained and allows applications to scale dynamically based on workload demands.
### 98. What  is  the  purpose  of  a  StatefulSet  in  Kubernetes?

Answer: A StatefulSet in Kubernetes is a resource object used to manage the deployment of stateful applications. It provides guarantees for ordering and uniqueness  of  pods,  allowing  each  pod  to  have  a  stable  hostname  and  persistent storage. StatefulSets are often used for databases, messaging systems, or other applications that require stable network identities and persistent data.

### 99. What  is  the  role  of  a  DaemonSet  in  Kubernetes?

Answer: A DaemonSet in Kubernetes is a resource object that ensures a specific pod  runs  on  each  node  in  a  cluster.  It  is  used  for  deploying  system-level  daemons or infrastructure components that should be present on every node, such as logging  agents,  monitoring  agents,  or  network  proxies.

### 100. Explain  the  concept  of  ClusterIP  in  Kubernetes.

Answer: ClusterIP in Kubernetes is a type of service that exposes an internal IP address within the cluster. It allows other pods or services within the cluster to access the service using the ClusterIP. ClusterIP services are typically used for communication between services within the cluster and are not accessible from outside the cluster.
